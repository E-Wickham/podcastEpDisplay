# Buzzsprout Episode Handler
Displaying podcast metadata pulled from the Buzzsprout API so podcasters can maximize views on their website, not the podcast host's.

Most podcasters do not have a background in web design, so this project is meant to be used by someone who needs to be able to have a project up and functioning ASAP, with as few clicks/changes as possible.

You can see a live example of this project at https://bigshinytakes.com/episodes.php

**Tech used**

- PHP 
- Vanilla Javascript 
- Bootstrap

This project is pretty much plug in and play. I would change the image in the assets folder, then in the buzzsproutAPI model insert your buzzsprout link in the url variable and add your own auth token
