# podcastEpDisplay
Displaying podcast metadata pulled from the Buzzsprout API so podcasters can maximize views on their website, not the podcast host's. 

**Tech used**
PHP, Vanilla Javascript, Bootstrap

This project is pretty much plug in and play. I would change the image in the assets folder, then in the buzzsproutAPI model insert your buzzsprout link in the url variable and add your own auth token
